<p id="description">
  Greetings everyone, here you can find the source code of my project as well as a small description of the project functionality and explanation of their implementation. My recipe website was created to make it easier for users to share their favourite     recipes and find new ones.
</p> 
<p>
  This project was done as part of my term project at university. Due to the terms of the course project the entire project was done without the use of third-party libraries and frameworks. This is my most extensive project so far.

<h2>💻 Built with</h2>

Technologies used in the project:

*   HTML
*   CSS
*   JavaScript (client-side verification, AJAX)
*   PHP (server-side verification, database communication)
*   MySQL (tables for recipes, users, etc.)

<br>


<h2>✍️ Lessons learned</h2>

This project has taught me:

*   To divide one big task into smaller subtasks and complete them in a timely manner.
*   Not to be lazy to return to old parts of the code to optimise it and fix significant errors.
*   Working alone it is difficult to achieve large-scale results. Teamwork is the key to success.
*   A lot of time is wasted in the rush to bring the code to perfection. You should be able to feel the line between "raw" and "good enough" code and start the next task in time.

<h2>✅ To do list</h2>

There is still much to be done...

1.	Allow users to edit and move ingredients when creating a recipe.
2.	Add a search engine in the navigator.
3.	Add the ability to search for recipes by tags.
4.	Add a system of recipe likes and comments.
5.	Add a "Favourites" page.
6.	Adapt my website to all devices with a responsive design.
